		<p style="width: 800px;font-size: 110%;margin-bottom: 40px;">Our research spans a few domains in Evolutionary and Cancer Genomics.</p>
		<h2>Cancer Genomics</h2>
		<p style="width: 800px;font-size: 110%;margin-bottom: 40px;">In cancer genomics, we are interested in the origin and evolution of intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH).  Focusing on lung and liver cancers, we are doing multi-sectoring sequencing of multiple tumors, understanding the amount and origin of ITH.  In lung cancer, we joined the flagship program (Translational and Clinical Research, TCR) together with my colleagues (Axel, Bing, Wai Leong and Daniel) trying to understand the ITH in lung adenocarcinoma in East Asian patients.  In Liver cancer, we are collaborating with colleagues from SGH/NCC(Pierce Chow and Tony Lim) understanding the evolution of liver cancers. </p>
		<p style="width: 800px;font-size: 110%;margin-bottom: 40px;">In the long run, we are interested in connecting the profile of ITH to macro-phenotypes (e.g.  patient survival or clinical trajectories, patient image data etc) and with micro-phenotypes (cancer microenvironment and immune-profiling, cancer metabolism etc). </p>		
		
		<h2>Evolutionary Genetics</h2>
		<h3>1) The evolution of influenza virus</h3>
		<p style="width: 800px;font-size: 110%;margin-bottom: 40px;">How flu virus adapts to the human environment is an interesting question for us.  In particular, we are keen on understanding the long term trajectories of influenza adaptation and what are the evolutionary driving forces promoting flu adaptation.  We are employing a sampling strategy called mutational mapping to study flu adaptation across space and time.  Practically, understanding how influenza adapts will pave important basis for vaccine design and public health management. </p>
		<h3>2) The evolution of domestic dogs</h3>
		<p style="width: 800px;font-size: 110%;margin-bottom: 40px;">Domesticated animals and plants are the basis of modern civilization.  How these species adapt to the societal need is an interesting evolutionary question.  Understanding the genetic basis of these large morphological and physiological changes is an important first step for breed improvement.  We have been employing the state of the art genomic and population genetic approach in understanding dog evolution.  Collaborating with colleagues from Kunming Institute of Zoology (Yaping Zhang and Guodong Wang), we have made a series of discoveries in dog evolution and global migration. </p>
		
		<h2>Other directions</h2>
		<h3>i) Normal homeostasis and evo-devo</h3>
		<p style="width: 800px;font-size: 110%;margin-bottom: 40px;">Organismal development is an amazing cellular orchestra starting from a single zygote. This group of cells with diverse functions is first built following large scale construction and deconstruction of many components (morphogenesis). Subsequently, they are actively maintained though homeostasis. There are many interesting population genetic and evolutionary questions in this regard. For example, what is the genealogical relationship of all cells within a multi-cellular organism? What are the roles of stem cells in the genealogy? How this genealogy might differ within and between species? </p>
		<h3>ii) Genome wide association studies</h3>
		<p style="width: 800px;font-size: 110%;margin-bottom: 40px;">I maintain my own interests in the Genome Wide Association studies. Many questions including the inter-relationship between disease causing alleles and natural selection, the fitness effects of natural mutations are tightly linked to the disease mapping. </p>
